used to redirect like this example:
A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is used to map one domain name to another domain name. 
It is often used when a domain name needs to be pointed to another domain name, 
instead of an IP address.

Here is an example of a CNAME record:

blog.example.com. 32600 IN CNAME example.com.

In this example, the CNAME record maps the subdomain blog.example.com 
to the domain example.com. 
When a DNS server looks up the IP address for blog.example.com, 
it will be redirected to example.com.
