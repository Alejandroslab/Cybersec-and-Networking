You may want to update the TXT records (like when you want to add an SPF rule):

This may be difficult in a e.g. corporate setting when you usually have multiple dns server (for security and redundancy/load balancing).

To sync TXT records among multiple DNS servers, you need to use a method that can propagate the changes to all the servers that host your domain. There are different ways to do this, depending on the platform and the configuration of your DNS service. Here are some possible methods:

Use a primary and secondary DNS server setup, where the primary server is the authoritative source of your DNS records, and the secondary servers are configured to receive updates from the primary server. You can use a tool like BIND or Microsoft DNS to set up this configuration. You need to make sure that the primary and secondary servers are in sync, and that the secondary servers can handle the queries if the primary server is down.

Use a distributed database system, where your DNS records are stored in a cloud-based service that can replicate the data to multiple servers around the world. You can use a service like Amazon Route 53 or Google Cloud DNS to set up this configuration. You need to make sure that the service can handle the traffic and the latency of your DNS queries, and that it can provide security and reliability for your DNS records.

Use a synchronization tool, where you can manually or automatically update your DNS records on multiple servers using a script or a software. You can use a tool like DNS Sync or DNS Made Easy to set up this configuration. You need to make sure that the tool can support the types and the formats of your DNS records, and that it can handle the errors and the conflicts that may arise during the synchronization process.
