The authoritative server in DNS is the name server that has the original and definitive records for a domain name.
It is the ultimate source of truth for resolving queries about that domain name. 
For example, if you want to know the IP address of stackoverflow.com, you need to ask the authoritative server for stackoverflow.com, which is ns51.domaincontrol.com 
according to the SOA record.

(The SOA record is the first record in every zone file, and it is essential for the proper functioning of the DNS!
It helps to ensure the consistency and accuracy of 
the zone data across different servers, and to prevent unauthorized or outdated responses)


There are usually multiple authoritative servers for a domain name,
to provide redundancy and reliability. 
The RFC 1034 recommends at least two authoritative servers for each domain name.

The authoritative servers can be either primary or secondary. 
The primary server is the one that is configured by the domain administrator and holds the original zone records. 
The secondary servers are the ones that synchronize with the primary server and keep a copy of the zone records. 
Both primary and secondary servers are authoritative and can answer queries for the domain name.

To find the authoritative servers for a domain name, you can use various tools, such as nslookup, dig, or online DNS lookup services. 

These tools will query the root name servers and then follow the referrals until they reach the authoritative servers for the domain name. 

For example, to find the authoritative servers for stackoverflow.com using dig, you can use the following command:

dig +short NS stackoverflow.com

This will return the following output:

ns52.domaincontrol.com. ns51.domaincontrol.com.

These are the authoritative servers for stackoverflow.com. You can also use the +trace option to see the full path of the query from the root name servers to the authoritative servers.
