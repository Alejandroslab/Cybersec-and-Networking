Whenever you need to allow a particular server to send an email you must create an
SPF string inside your DNS server (or in all of your DNS server with a propagation strategy)

the SPF string is a particular TXT record (check all the list of the DNS type of records)
(another type of record is DKIM, DMARC...)

an example:

v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
