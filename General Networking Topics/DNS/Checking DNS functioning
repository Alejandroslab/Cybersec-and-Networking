If you want to check your DNS and if it is working properly just use nslookup

nslookup (from name server lookup) is a network administration command-line tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain the mapping between domain name and IP address, or other DNS records.

it is a command.

You can use it:

nslookup any_ip

or:

nslookup google.com
Server:         192.168.1.1 
Address:        192.168.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   google.com
Address: 142.251.209.46

The first IP in the first line is the IP of your DNS server!


INTERACTIVE MODE:

or you can use it interactively just type

nslookup

Now the terminal or cmd in Windows will enter in another console
in which you can test any machine you want and check if the hostname is pointig to the right machine
