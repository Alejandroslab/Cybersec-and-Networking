RFCs (Request for Comments from IETF) mandate that a hostname's labels may contain only the ASCII letters 'a' through 'z' (case-insensitive), 
the digits '0' through '9', and the hyphen. 
Hostname labels cannot begin or end with a hyphen. 
No other symbols, punctuation characters, or blank spaces are permitted.
