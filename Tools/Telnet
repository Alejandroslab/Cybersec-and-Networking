Telnet is a protocol that allows you to access and manage remote network devices over the Internet, such as servers, routers, switches, and others1. 
With Telnet, you can establish a virtual terminal connection with a remote device and send text commands as if you were physically present in front of the device2. 
Telnet uses the TCP protocol to transmit data between the client and the server, and uses port 23 by default2. 
Telnet is an old and simple protocol, that does not offer any security or encryption of data. 
For this reason, it has been replaced by the SSH protocol, which offers a secure and protected connection


Telnet can be used in Linux. 
Telnet is a cross-platform protocol that can be used on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

to use it:

telnet localhost 25
