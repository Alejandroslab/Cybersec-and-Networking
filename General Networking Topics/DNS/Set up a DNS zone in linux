To set up a DNS zone in Linux, you need to install and configure a DNS server software, 
such as BIND, and create and edit zone files that contain the records for your domain.
A zone file is a text file that defines the mappings between domain names and IP addresses.
There are two types of zone files: forward and reverse. A forward zone file maps domain names to IP addresses, while a reverse zone file maps IP addresses to domain names. Here are the basic steps to set up a DNS zone in Linux:

Install the DNS server software. 

For example, to install BIND on Debian or Ubuntu, you can use the command: 
sudo apt install bind9.

Configure the DNS server software. 
For example, to configure BIND, you need to edit the file /etc/bind/named.conf and add the entries for your zone files. You can use the zone directive to specify the name, type, and file name of your zone. For example, to add a forward zone for the domain example.com, you can use the following entry:
zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.example.com";
};

Create and edit the zone files. 

For example, to create and edit the forward zone file for example.com, you can use the command: 
sudo nano /etc/bind/db.example.com. 

You need to add the records for your domain, such as SOA, NS, A, CNAME, MX, etc. 
For example, to add an A record for www.example.com, you can use the following entry:
www     IN      A       192.168.1.10

Restart the DNS server software. For example, to restart BIND, you can use the command:
sudo systemctl restart bind9.
Test the DNS zone. 

You can use tools like dig, nslookup, or host to query your DNS server and check if it can resolve your domain names correctly. 
For example, to query the A record for www.example.com, you can use the command:
dig @localhost www.example.com A.
