The most convenient option to rent a virtual server is a VPS with Linux, because you don't need to pay for any license. 

Linux is integrated into the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), which forms the basis of many web applications. 

It is considered a secure operating system that is unlikely to suffer cyberattacks. 

At the same time, you will enjoy maximum flexibility: you decide all the configurations to be undertaken.


Remember:
Hosting < VPS < Dedicated server

the hosting is the most easy way to manage a website

a VPS allows more flexibility as you have an entire OS even if it is shared among multiple clients of the provider

Finally the deidicated server you have an entire bare metal server for you
