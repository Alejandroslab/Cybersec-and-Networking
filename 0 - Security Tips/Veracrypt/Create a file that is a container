A container is like an encrypted folder with veracrypt therefore encrypted with top notch security methods 

you can move these containers as you wish!

if you frget the password you will not be able to retrieve it!



Using the GUI just go to Volumes and select 'Create a New Volume'

Choose 'Create an encrypted container'

next, just leave the common options as they are sufficiently safe for your use (most of the time...

Now select where you want to save the container and just create it with a name

then leave AES and SHA512

now choose the size. the size will depend on  the size of the data you want to encrypt

if your data is 10gb then insert 10 or 11 gb. Is up to you 


then choose the STRONG password that will encrypt the container


for large files just choose no (unless you have files with more than 4gb of size)

leave filesystem as FAT

then move the  mouse to collect randomness

finally click on format

wait 
done! 

now you have the contaainer that you can mount with veracrypt 
just click on the file that has been saved and choose open with veracrypt and type in your password. 
the container will mount and you can finally manage that

when you have finished just unmount it with veracrypt (do not use the system unmount feature as this will not lock the container and your data will be visible)




Final note:
As the GUI has currently some hiccups (like 'Broken Pipe Write Error 384') to unmount the container is recommended to use command line (it is way much easier too ..)
