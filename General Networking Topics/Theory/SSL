Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a protocol for encrypting HTTP traffic, such as connections between user devices and web servers 1. Websites that use SSL encryption have https:// in their URLs instead of http://.

SSL was replaced several years ago by Transport Layer Security (TLS), but the term “SSL” is still in common use for referring to the protocol 1. In addition to encrypting client-server communications in web browsing, SSL can also be used in VPNs 1.
