In general, emails are not encrypted by default while they travel between email servers, which makes them vulnerable 
to cyberattacks. 
However, there are methods to protect emails with encryption, which consists of encoding the content of emails 
so that only the intended recipient can read it. 
There are two main types of encryption for emails: encryption in transit and end-to-end encryption. 
Encryption in transit uses the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol to prevent the reading of emails after
they have been sent and before they are delivered. This type of encryption is used by the main email providers, 
such as Microsoft and Google. End-to-end encryption, on the other hand, 
ensures that emails are encrypted by the sender and can only be decrypted by the recipient on their own device.
This type of encryption is more secure, but requires the use of public and private keys to encode and decode messages. 
End-to-end encryption is used by some specialized email services, such as ProtonMail and Tutanota.
