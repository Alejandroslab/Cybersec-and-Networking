Spoofing is a computer attack technique that consists of falsifying the identity of a device, 
a user or a service on a network, in order to obtain confidential information, 
spread malware or evade security controls. Spoofing can occur at different levels of the ISO/OSI communication model, 
and can also involve the falsification of application information, such as emails or websites. 
Spoofing is often used in combination with other social engineering techniques to deceive victims and persuade them to provide sensitive data or access malicious sites. 
Spoofing can have different purposes, such as identity theft, phishing, denial of service or man in the middle. 
To defend against spoofing, it is important to use common sense and prudence when browsing the web or receiving suspicious emails, and adopt protection measures such as authentication, encryption, filtering or source verification.
