To host a domain that is exposed to the internet on Linux, you need to do the following steps:

Install a web server, such as Apache, Nginx, or Lighttpd, on your Linux machine. 

You can use the package manager of your Linux distribution to do this. 

For example, on Ubuntu, you can run sudo apt install apache2 to install Apache.
Configure your web server to listen on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) and serve the files and scripts of your website. 

You may need to create a virtual host for your domain and enable the necessary modules and features for your website. 

You can refer to the documentation of your web server for more details.
Register a domain name from a domain name registrar, such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains. 

You can choose any domain name that is available and suits your website’s purpose4.
Point your domain name to your Linux machine’s public IP address. 

You can do this by creating an A record or an AAAA record in your domain name registrar’s DNS management panel. 

You may also need to create other DNS records, such as CNAME, MX, or TXT, depending on your website’s needs4.
If your Linux machine is behind a router or a firewall, you may need to set up port forwarding or NAT to allow incoming traffic to your web server. 

You may also need to configure your router or firewall to allow outgoing traffic from your web server.
If your Linux machine does not have a static public IP address, you may need to use a dynamic DNS service, such as No-IP, DynDNS, or PageKite, to update your domain name with your current IP address. 

You may need to install a client software on your Linux machine to do this5.
Test your website by visiting your domain name from a web browser. 

You should see your website’s content and functionality as expected. 

If not, you may need to troubleshoot your web server, DNS, or network settings3.
