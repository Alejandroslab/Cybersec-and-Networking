To do that remember to add your current user to sudo group

/etc/ssh/sshd_config 

change the: “PermitRootLogin” to no

you can also change the ssh port



Disable then IPV6
edit /etc/sysconfig/ network and update the settings so that they read NETWORKING_ IPV6=no and IPV6INIT=no.


Use backups
