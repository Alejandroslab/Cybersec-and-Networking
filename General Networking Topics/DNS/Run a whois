For example:

On Ubuntu or Debian, you can use: sudo apt install whois
On Fedora, you can use: sudo dnf install whois
On OpenSUSE, you can use: sudo zypper in whois
On Arch Linux, you can use: sudo pacman -S whois
After installing the whois utility, you can use it in the terminal by typing whois followed by a domain name or an IP address. For example:

To get information about the domain linuxconfig.org, you can use: whois linuxconfig.org
