here are many types of records that exist in DNS, which is a system that maps domain names to internet protocol (IP) addresses and vice versa. Some of the most commonly used DNS record types are:

A — IPv4 address record. Returns a 32-bit IPv4 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host1.

AAAA — IPv6 address record. Returns a 128-bit IPv6 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host1.

CNAME — Canonical name record. Alias of one name to another: the DNS lookup will continue by retrying the lookup with the new name2.

MX — Mail exchange record. Maps a domain name to a list of mail exchange servers for that domain2.

NS — Name server record. Delegates a DNS zone to use the given authoritative name servers2.

TXT — Text record. Carries human-readable or machine-readable data, such as SPF, DKIM, DMARC, etc2.

SOA — Start of authority record. Specifies authoritative information about a DNS zone, such as the primary name server, the email of the domain administrator, the domain serial number, and several timers relating to refreshing the zone2.
