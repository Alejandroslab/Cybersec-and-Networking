The public DNS resolver offered by Cloudflare. Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 is a free and fast DNS recursor that anyone can use. 
It also provides security and privacy features, such as encryption and filtering.
You can change your DNS settings to use 1.1.1.1 as your DNS recursor instead of your ISP’s DNS resolver.
The DNS recursor built into your operating system. Some operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS, have their own DNS recursors that can perform DNS lookups locally. 
These DNS recursors can use a combination of cached data, hosts files, and network configuration to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
