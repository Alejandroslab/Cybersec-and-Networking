Whenever you need to allow a particular server to send an email you must create an
SPF string inside your DNS server (or in all of your DNS server with a propagation strategy)

the SPF string is a particular TXT record (check all the list of the DNS type of records)
(another type of record is DKIM, DMARC...)

an example:

v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all

you may wnat to add the Micorsoft 365 (most common use cas) as you may wnat to send
email from Exchange that is not the same server where your domain is hosted

v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all
