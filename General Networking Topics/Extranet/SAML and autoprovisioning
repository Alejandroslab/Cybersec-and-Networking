Self-provisioning in SAML is a feature that allows you to automatically create user accounts in your service provider (SP) 
when users authenticate through your identity provider (IdP). 
This way, users don't have to manually register in the SP, but can log in to the services 
with the same credentials they use in the IdP. 
Self-provisioning in SAML is based on SAML assertions, 
which are XML-formatted messages that contain authentication and authentication information.
